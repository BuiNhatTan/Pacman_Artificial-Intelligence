# Pacman_Artificial-Intelligence
Pacman game with DFS, BFS, UCS,A* (manhattanHeuristic, canberraHeuristic, euclideanHeuristic, chebyshevHeuristic) algorithms

This is the project I make for AI class in my university. This code include DFS, BFS, UCS and A* algorthims. I try manhattanHeuristic, canberraHeuristic, euclideanHeuristic, chebyshevHeuristic)
for A* algorthims.



To run this code please type in terminal:

python2 pacman.py -l mediumMaze.lay (or your choice of layout)  -p AStarFoodSearchAgent (or your choice of algorithm)
